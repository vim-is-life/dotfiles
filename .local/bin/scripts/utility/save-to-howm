Usage:
  save-to-howm <filename> [format]

Arguments:
  filename   (mandatory)   the name of the file to save. i only need the
                           basename, as i search for pictures in your
                           ~/Downloads. do note that i will delete the original
                           from your downloads to save you space. please note that i will poop the bed if your

  format     (optional)    the format to convert the image to. one of 'jpg' or
                           'avif'. i use jpg by default because it seems Emacs
                           28.2 doesn't work with avif and the Emacs that Debian
                           supplies seems to not be built with ImageMagick
                           support to be able to use it as an external converter
                           to view avif images."
